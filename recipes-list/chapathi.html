    <h1> Chapathi </h1>
    <img src="chapathi.jpg" alt="Chapathi image" width="30%">
    <p>Chapathi, also spelled as chapati, is a type of unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent.
        It's made from whole wheat flour, water, and sometimes a bit of salt. The dough is rolled out into thin circles
        and then cooked on a hot griddle or tawa until it's slightly puffed and golden brown. Chapathi is a staple in
        Indian cuisine and is commonly served with a variety of dishes such as vegetables, curries, and lentils. It's
        prized for its simplicity and versatility, and it's a fundamental part of many meals in the region.

    <h2>Basic recipe for making chapathi:</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (more as needed)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil or ghee (optional, for softer chapathis)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> the Dough:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.</li>
                <li>Gradually add water, a little at a time, while mixing the flour with your fingers or a spoon.</li>
                <li>Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands for about 5-7 minutes until it’s
                    smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too dry, add a bit more water. If it’s too sticky, add a
                    little more flour.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Rest the Dough:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes. This
                    helps to make
                    the chapathis softer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Divide and Roll:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>After resting, divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
                <li>On a lightly floured surface, take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your fingers. Using a
                    rolling pin,
                    roll it out into a thin, round disc. Try to make it as even as possible, and use flour to prevent
                    sticking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Cook the Chapathi:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Place the rolled-out dough onto the hot griddle. Cook for about 30 seconds, or until you see
                    bubblesforming on the surface.</li>
                <li>Flip the chapathi and cook the other side for another 30 seconds. You can press gently with a cloth
                    or spatula to help it puff up.</li>
                <li>Flip again if needed, and cook until both sides have golden brown spots.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Optional Step for Soft Chapathis</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If you like, you can brush the chapathi with a little oil or ghee while it’s still hot. This will keep it soft and add extra flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve the chapathis warm with your favorite curry, vegetable dish, or side.</li>               
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
  <p> Enjoy your chapathis! </p>
